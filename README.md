# New-MtrWallpaper

Configure a new wallpaper for Microsoft Teams Room (MTR) System

## Description

Wallpaper is then copied to the proper folder, and a corresponding XML file is also written.

When the system reboots as part of its normal scheduled nightly maintenance, the new wallpaper is set for the 'Custom' them in MTR.

## Notes

None for now. May play with configuring a list of dates and corresponding wallpaper images (*think holiday wallpapers*).

All Images _must_ be exactly 3840Ã—1080, for Single or dual screen MTR systems!!!

If you copy the wallpaper image (wallpaper.jpg), with or without the settings XML, to different MTR systems the change will not be activated!
The MTR doesn't do a reload or check if a file is changed.
The MTR will reboot every day at 2:30 (AM), then the changes will be activated.

The MTR support .jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .bmp for wallpapers!

**This script supports only .jpg for now!**

A future version might bring support for other formats, until then you need to use JPG (.jpg).
Tell me if you are interested in such an enhancement!

My version of the script has no enhancements, at least not yet!
It's just a minor changed version based on the great work of Pat Richard.

## Origial Readme

This script, when run on a Microsoft Teams Room (MTR) System, will configure a new, randomly selected wallpaper, each day. The script pics the wallpaper from a folder, copies it to the appropriate folder, then writes a SkypeSettings.xml file that contains the relevant configuration info. MTRs have a built in process that includes a daily reboot. New-MtrWallpaper.ps1 leverages that reboot to enable the new wallpaper.
You can manually run the code in Create-MtrWallpaperScheduledTask.ps1 to create the actual scheduled task if desired.
